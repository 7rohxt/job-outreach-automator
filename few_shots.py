Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the AI/ML Engineer position. My expertise in Python, algorithms, and cloud deployment aligns well with your requirements. At NeubAItics, I built and dockerized a real-time face attendance system using FastAPI, OpenCV, and Firebase, and developed a multi-camera DeepSORT-based tracking system, showcasing strong skills in scalable ML applications.

I have deployed solutions on AWS EC2, integrated Docker, and applied MLOps practices for production-ready pipelines. Projects such as my LoRA fine-tuned LLM deployment and Text-to-SQL agent further demonstrate experience with TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and LangChain.

Although under five years of experience, my research on hybrid CNN-LSTM models (95.7% accuracy) and hands-on work with Kubernetes and Terraform illustrate adaptability and depth in ML engineering.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my skills in cloud-based ML engineering and MLOps to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Rohit Karthick"""
