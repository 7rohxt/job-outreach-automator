            Dear Hiring Manager,

            I am excited to apply for the AI/ML Engineer role. My expertise lies in Python, deep learning, and deploying ML models on AWS cloud environments. At Visionary AI Labs, I developed image classification pipelines using TensorFlow, automated workflows with Airflow, and deployed scalable ML services with SageMaker and Docker.

            I also have hands-on experience building NLP models with Transformers for sentiment analysis and integrating them into production using FastAPI and Kubernetes. My projects, such as demand forecasting and defect detection, highlight my ability to create applied AI systems that directly support business decisions.

            Although early in my career, my research on hybrid CNN-RNN models for medical imaging and practical exposure to MLOps tools (MLflow, Terraform) demonstrate adaptability and depth in ML engineering.

            I would welcome the opportunity to contribute my skills in scalable ML systems and AWS-powered AI engineering to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.
