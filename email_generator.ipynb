      "Dear Hiring Manager,\n",
      "\n",
      "I am excited to apply for the Senior AI/ML Engineer position, where I can utilize my expertise in Python, machine learning, and cloud computing to drive business growth. With a strong foundation in programming languages, cloud platforms, and machine learning frameworks, I am confident in my ability to develop robust AI solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience with Python, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Tensorflow aligns well with your requirements. I have successfully deployed projects using these frameworks, including a LoRA fine-tuned LLM for domain-specific text understanding and a Text-to-SQL agent that converts natural language queries into SQL. Additionally, my work with Docker and AWS EC2 demonstrates my proficiency in containerization and cloud deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a skilled engineer, I have developed scalable applications that leverage prediction models and optimization programs. My project, \"Fake Reviews Classifier,\" showcases my ability to design and implement scalable solutions using Flask, CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, and classifier. I have also worked with Spark and FastAPI, which are essential for data processing and building efficient data pipelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I have less than 5-7 years of professional experience, my research and projects demonstrate equivalent expertise. My academic research on heart sound anomaly detection using Conv1D and LSTM, published in the SN Computer Science Journal, showcases my ability to work on complex projects. I have also developed multiple projects, including an LLM-based system for summarizing NGO reports, an interactive bot using LangChain and LLaMA-based models, and a comparative study of sentiment classification performance using traditional NLP pipelines and transformer-based models.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am eager to bring my skills and experience to your team and contribute to the development of robust machine learning and generative AI solutions. Please feel free to contact me to discuss my application.\n",
