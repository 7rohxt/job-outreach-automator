      "I'm excited to apply for the Senior AI/ML Engineer position at Nike, where I can leverage my skills in machine learning, cloud architecture, and data engineering to drive business impact. With a strong foundation in Python, algorithms, and data structures, I'm confident in my ability to develop robust AI solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience with TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch aligns with the job requirements, and I've demonstrated proficiency in these frameworks through projects like the LoRA Fine-Tuning Project and Heart Sound Anomaly Detection using Conv1D and LSTM. I've also worked with FastAPI, Docker, and AWS EC2, which are essential for cloud architecture and deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a Machine Learning Engineer at NeubAItics Pvt. Tech. Ltd., I've developed real-time systems using OpenCV, FastAPI, and Docker, showcasing my ability to work with complex data sets and ETL pipelines. My project, Fake Reviews Classifier, deployed on AWS EC2, demonstrates my understanding of cloud architecture and technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I have less than 5 years of professional experience, my achievements and projects, such as the LoRA Fine-Tuning Project, IPL Insights Bot, and Text-to-SQL Agent, showcase my capabilities in MLOps, pipeline orchestration, and data engineering. I'm eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to Nike's Corporate Functions Artificial Intelligence team and contribute to delivering AI capabilities for Nike's corporate functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd love to discuss how my skills and experience align with the role and explore how I can make a meaningful impact at Nike. Please find my resume and portfolio attached. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Nike's innovative AI initiatives.\n",
