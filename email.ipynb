      "At WTMF, we’re not just building another AI tool. We’re building an AI bestie — someone you can rant to at 2 AM, track your moods with, help you journal, remind you about life, and maybe even drop some wisdom when you least expect it.To pull this off, we need people who live and breathe AI/ML. People who look at a messy dataset and see… potential. People who get excited about fine-tuning models the way others get excited about cricket scores or Netflix drops.Who we’re looking forSomeone who:Thinks transformers are cooler than Optimus Prime.Knows that “loss” isn’t just an emotion, it’s something you reduce.Gets a little too happy when an experiment finally converges.Wants to work on AI that feels less robotic and more human.What you’ll actually doTrain, fine-tune, and optimize models that power our AI companion.Experiment with LLMs, embeddings, and recommendation systems to make conversations smarter and more personal.Work with data (structured, unstructured, and occasionally chaotic) to give our bestie a memory.Collaborate with product and design teams to translate “wouldn’t it be cool if…” into working features.Keep an eye on performance, cost, and ethics — because great AI should also be responsible.What you should bringA solid background in ML, deep learning, or NLP (bonus if you’ve wrestled with large language models before).Comfort with frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.Enough math/statistics chops to know why your model is misbehaving.The ability to prototype quickly, fail gracefully, and try again.Experience in productionizing models is a big plus — research is great, but shipping is magic.Why you might love thisYou’ll be shaping the brain of an AI bestie used across the globe.You’ll have freedom to experiment, iterate, and see your work impact users directly.Competitive pay, equity options, and the chance to be part of a small but ambitious team.Work from anywhere, with people who are equally obsessed with AI and making it useful (and fun).\n",
